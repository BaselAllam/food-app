// Default class VS Widget
    // 1- Container which contains a block of code that related to specific thing
    // 2- the class that inherit from Stateless or Stateful Widget and can be rendered



// StatelessWidget VS StatefulWidget
    // 1- Stateless => 
          // class which make any class inherite from can be rendered, but its be as a static class
          // its a static class because it doesn't has a State class


    // 2- Stateful => 
          // class which make any class inehrite from can get a State Class, 
          // inside state class we use build method 


    // 3- State => 
          // class inherit from to get the ability to change and define variables and methods that works side by side
          // with build method




// build method
    // 1- its a method of stateless or statefull widget
    // 2- its must be overrided
    // 3- it only returns Widget
    // 4- its has a positional arg called BuildContext Widget
    // 5- its actually which render my screen




// 1- Widget is Immutable
// 2- Why ScreenState is a private class
